# Web Scraping

## About

This is my web scraping repo.

I made my first web scraping script to pull the names and emails of all Canadian members of parliament. I wanted these emails so I could contact them about the causes I care about.

## Instructions

1. Install Python3
2. Install scrapy
3. Run `scrapy runspider scrape-ourcommons.py -O mps.json`
